<p>Filipino Carbonara is more of a pasta Alfredo with bacon. It is richer and creamier than the traditional version.<br>
This is attributed to the use of heavy cream. Italian carbonara, on the other hand, makes use of beaten eggs with <br>
Pecorino Romano cheese and lots of ground black pepper for the sauce.</p>
